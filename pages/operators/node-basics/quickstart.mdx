# Node Operator Quickstart

Becoming a node operator on the Tangle Network requires some technical skills, trust, and support from the community. Below
is a collection of quick links for quick setups!

### Key Mainnet Details

- Native token: `TNT`
- Decimals: 18
- Chain ID: `5845`
- RPC endpoint: `https://rpc.tangle.tools`
- WSS endpoint: `wss://rpc.tangle.tools`

# Tangle Network Mainnet Node Quickstart

This guide provides a quickstart for anyone looking to run a Tangle Network node and participate in mainnet. Before following this guide, please ensure your machine meets the [hardware requirements](./hardware.mdx) and has the necessary dependencies installed.

## 1. Update to Latest Node Release

Visit the [Tangle releases page](https://github.com/tangle-network/tangle/releases) and download the latest version of the `tangle` binary for your operating system. For example, for release v1.0.0 on Linux you would run:

`wget https://github.com/tangle-network/tangle/releases/download/v1.0.0/tangle-linux-amd64`

Make the downloaded binary executable:

`chmod +x tangle-default-linux-amd64`

## 2. Start the Node

To start your node and connect it to the Tangle mainnet, run:

```
./tangle-default-linux-amd64

--base-path <BASE_PATH> \

--chain tangle-mainnet.json

--name <NODE_NAME>

--validator

--telemetry-url "wss://telemetry.polkadot.io/submit/ 1"
```

Replace `<BASE_PATH>` with the directory where your node's data will be stored, and `<NODE_NAME>` with a unique name to identify your node.

## 3. Stake TNT to Validate

To be eligible as a validator, you will need to stake Tangle's native token TNT. More details on the minimum staking requirements and how to stake will be provided closer to mainnet genesis.

Please see our new **[Start Validating guide.](../validator/introduction.mdx)**

## Monitoring

Monitoring your node is critical. Refer to the [monitoring docs](../monitoring/quickstart.mdx) for instructions on setting up monitoring.
