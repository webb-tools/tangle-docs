# Running a Tangle Node

This guide provides an overview of the Tangle Network software and instructions on how to run a node.

## Prerequisites

Before running a Tangle node, ensure that your machine meets the following requirements:

- Operating System: Linux (recommended), macOS, or Windows
- Hardware: Sufficient CPU, RAM, and storage capacity to synchronize and store the blockchain data

## Installing the Tangle Node Binary

To install the Tangle node binary, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest release binary from the [Tangle releases page](https://github.com/tangle-network/tangle/releases). The current latest version is 1.0.0.

   ```sh filename="Get binary" copy
   wget https://github.com/tangle-network/tangle/releases/download/v1.0.0/tangle-default-linux-amd64

   ```

2. Make the downloaded binary executable
   `chmod +x tangle-default-linux-amd64`

## Running the Tangle Node

To start your Tangle node and begin synchronizing with the network, run the following command:
`./tangle-default-linux-amd64`

Your node will start synchronizing with the Tangle Network. Once the synchronization process is complete, your node will be fully operational.

### Running a Node with SystemD or Docker

For production environments, it is recommended to run your Tangle node using a process manager like SystemD or Docker. This ensures that your node runs consistently and automatically restarts in case of any issues.

Please refer to the guides in sidebar for instructions on running a Tangle node with SystemD or Docker.

## Default Ports for a Tangle Node

The following table lists the default ports used by a Tangle node:

## Feature Flags

The Tangle node software includes several feature flags that enable additional functionality. Here are some notable feature flags:

- `txpool`: Enables transaction tracing and debugging for EVM transactions.
- `relayer`: Starts an embedded transaction relayer for transaction relaying and data querying.
- `light-client`: Starts an embedded light client for syncing EVM data on Tangle.

To build the Tangle node with specific feature flags enabled, use the following command:

`cargo build --release --features <feature-flag>`

Replace `<feature-flag>` with the desired feature flag(s) you want to enable.
