# Flags and Subcommands

Setting up a Tangle Network node involves various flags to configure its operation. This guide elucidates the commonly used flags and provides instructions on how to view the complete list.

<Callout>
Always refer to the official Substrate documentation for exhaustive details on [flags](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/command-line-tools/node-template/), [subcommands](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/command-line-tools/node-template/#subcommands), and [CLI tools and commands.](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/command-line-tools/) for Substrate-based nodes, including Tangle.
</Callout>

### Networking:

- `--port`: Define the TCP port for peer-to-peer protocols.
- `--rpc-port`: Unified port for both HTTP and WS connections.
- `--in-peers`: Limit on accepted incoming connections (Default: 25).
- `--out-peers`: Limit on maintained outgoing connections (Default: 25).

### Execution:

- `--execution`: Choose the execution strategy for all contexts based on the runtime compilation:

  - `native`: Use only the native build.
  - `wasm`: Use only the Wasm build.
  - `both`: Use both native and Wasm builds.
  - `nativeelsewasm`: Use native; if it fails, use Wasm.

- `--wasm-execution`: Method for executing Wasm runtime code:
  - `compiled`: Uses the Wasmtime compiled runtime (default).
  - `interpreted-i-know-what-i-do`: Uses the wasmi interpreter.

### State & Database:

- `--state-pruning`: Define the state pruning mode:

  - `archive`: Retain the full state of all blocks.
  - `<number-of-blocks>`: Retain state only for a specified number of blocks.

- `--trie-cache-size`: Set the internal state cache size.
- `--db-cache`: Limit the database cache's memory usage. Recommended: 50% of server RAM.

### File Paths & Chain Spec:

- `--base-path`: Path where chain data resides.
- `--chain`: Chain specification to use; can be a file path.

### Telemetry & Naming:

- `--name`: Assign a name to the node for telemetry.
- `--telemetry-url`: URL for the telemetry server. Can specify multiple URLs.

### Ethereum Compatibility (Frontier):

- `--eth-log-block-cache`: Limit for the LRU cache size for block data (Default: 300,000,000).
- `--eth-statuses-cache`: Limit for the LRU cache size for transaction statuses (Default: 300,000,000).

### Syncing:

- `--sync`: Configure the blockchain syncing mode:
  - `full`: Download and validate the full blockchain history.
  - `fast`: Download blocks without execution and get the latest state with proofs.
  - `fast-unsafe`: As 'fast', but without downloading state proofs.
  - `warp`: Download only the latest state and proof.

## Accessing All Flags

To see a full list of flags:

### Using Docker:

Confirm the path and image with your image name:

```
docker run --network="host" -v "/var/lib/data:/data"
-u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER})
ghcr.io/tangle-network/tangle/tangle:main --help
```

### Using Systemd:

If you used the binary directly:

`./tangle-YOUR-VERSION-HERE> --help`

If you compiled the binary:

`./target/release/tangle-YOUR-VERSION-HERE> --help`
