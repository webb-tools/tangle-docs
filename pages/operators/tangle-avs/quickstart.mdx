# Tangle AVS: Cross-Chain Quickstart Guide

The following is a guide outlining the steps to set up and utilize **Tangle AVS** (Actively Validated Services),
allowing you to run a Tangle Validator on **EigenLayer**'s network. If you do not have a Tangle node set up yet,
please review the **How to run a Tangle node** setup guide [here](../node-basics/quickstart.mdx).

This guide will help you get started with deploying the AVS and enabling cross-chain functionalities across multiple
blockchain protocols, specifically EigenLayer.

Here is how our final configuration will look at the end of this guide:

- **Tangle AVS** operates as an EigenLayer-compatible validator and supports cross-chain slashing.
- **EigenLayer** integration allows validators to re-stake and enhance security while also participating in Tangle’s
  validator ecosystem.
- **Symbiotic** will be integrated in the future, allowing cross-chain collaboration.
- **Message dispatching** between networks using **bridges**, **Hyperlane**, or **Sygma**.
- Optional **AVS and Blueprint Development tools in Rust** for developers who want to create their own AVSs or
  Blueprints to interact with the Tangle and/or EigenLayer network(s).

<Callout type="info">
    Ensure that you have everything necessary for running a Tangle node and have access to the necessary network
    configurations for EigenLayer or any other network you plan to connect to.
</Callout>

## Docker usage

---- INCLUDES PLACEHOLDER TEXT ----

The quickest way to set up the Tangle AVS with cross-chain functionalities is to use our provided scripts.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that the following is configured:

- Access to a running **EigenLayer node** and correct port exposure for cross-network communication.
- Set up necessary configurations for **bridges**, **Hyperlane**, or **Sygma** for message dispatching across networks.

### Usage

**To start the Tangle AVS, run:**

```sh filename="compose up" copy
cd avs-setup
./placeholder_setup_script.sh
```

## Cross-Chain Functionality Configuration

The Tangle AVS requires the registration of an Operator through both EigenLayer and Tangle - you must have the
configurations for both Operators accessible. For more information on cross-chain functionalities you can see
our [Cross-Chain Orchestration](cross-chain.mdx) section.

### EigenLayer Integration

    Ensure that the Tangle Validator is registered within the EigenLayer AVS and that the node is actively listening for cross-chain messages.
    Set up cross-chain slashing to be enforced across both Tangle and EigenLayer by dispatching slashing messages via Hyperlane or another communication protocol.

### Symbiotic Integration (Future)

    [Placeholder] Symbiotic integration is under development. Once available, you will be able to configure cross-chain slashing and collaborative consensus mechanisms across both Tangle and Symbiotic.

### Other Network Configurations

    For non-Tangle networks, configure Hyperlane or Sygma to handle cross-chain message dispatching and validator state updates across networks.

## Monitoring and Alerts

To monitor your Tangle AVS and its interactions across networks like EigenLayer, set up Prometheus and Grafana for
real-time tracking of your validator’s performance and cross-chain activities.

```sh filename="compose up" copy
cd monitoring
docker compose up -d
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view real-time metrics such as:

    Validator performance across EigenLayer and other networks.
    Cross-chain message dispatch status.
    Slashing events and validator health.

## Next Steps

You’ve successfully set up and configured your Tangle AVS with cross-chain functionalities! You can now participate in
EigenLayer’s re-staking mechanism while benefiting from Tangle’s cross-chain validator management.

Stay tuned for updates on Symbiotic and additional network integrations.
