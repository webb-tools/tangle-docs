# Overview

Cross-Chain Restaking with Tangle introduces secure and reliable interactions
across different blockchain ecosystems. Our system ensures that cross-chain actions — especially
slashing — are executed seamlessly and consistently, regardless of the network on which they originate or occur.
By enabling cross-chain slashing and communication, Tangle ensures that validators and protocols remain secure
and accountable across a decentralized multi-chain environment.

In this section, we will explore Tangle’s approach to Cross-Chain Restaking, focusing on how slashing events
are managed across different networks and how we use cross-chain communication protocols to maintain trust and
security between chains.

## Cross-Chain Slashing Mechanism

One of Tangle’s core innovations is the ability to enforce cross-chain slashing across multiple networks. This
capability enhances security and reduces malicious behavior, as validators know that misbehavior on any network can have
consequences across all networks they participate in.

### Key Aspects of Cross-Chain Slashing:

    - Slashing occurs on Tangle:
        When a validator misbehaves on a third-party network, such as EigenLayer or Symbiotic, Tangle enforces the
        slashing event. Regardless of which network is hosting the validator’s actions, slashing is performed on Tangle.
        Similarly, slashing events that originate on Tangle can be forwarded to non-Tangle networks to be handled accordingly.
        This centralized slashing mechanism ensures consistency and accountability.

    - Slashing is Communicated Back to the Source Network:
        After a slashing event is executed on Tangle, a message is dispatched back to the source protocol (EigenLayer,
        Symbiotic, etc.), informing the network of the penalty. This ensures that validators and protocols are properly
        updated across ecosystems, reflecting the consequence of any misbehavior in both the slashing network and the original protocol.

## Cross-Chain Communication Protocols

To ensure that slashing events and other cross-chain actions are communicated efficiently between networks, Tangle
integrates several cross-chain communication protocols. These protocols are essential for message dispatching and help
maintain synchronization between different blockchains.

### Supported Protocols for Message Dispatching:

    Bridges:
        Bridges allow for secure and reliable cross-chain transfers of tokens, data, and messages. In the context of
        Tangle, bridges serve as a critical infrastructure layer, enabling the delivery of slashing messages across networks.

    Hyperlane:
        Hyperlane is a protocol designed for general-purpose cross-chain messaging, which we use to facilitate secure
        and efficient communication between Tangle and other networks. Hyperlane’s messaging layer helps Tangle dispatch slashing
        messages quickly and with a high degree of trustlessness.

    Sygma:
        Sygma provides an additional layer of security for cross-chain message delivery. Tangle utilizes Sygma to ensure
        that messages are delivered safely and that data remains intact throughout the cross-chain communication process.
        Sygma’s focus on security helps us guarantee that slashing messages reach their destination reliably.

## Workflow: How It Works

Here’s an overview of how Tangle’s Cross-Chain Slashing operates:

    1. Validator Misbehavior Detection:
        A validator participating in both a Tangle Network and a non-Tangle network (e.g., EigenLayer, Symbiotic) is found guilty of some sort of misbehavior.

    2. Slashing Event Triggered on Tangle:
        Based on the infraction, a slashing event is initiated within the Tangle protocol. This is done by listening for relevant messages on said non-Tangle
        network, then forwarding that to Tangle.

    3. Message Dispatching:
        After the slashing is executed, Tangle dispatches a message containing details of the slashing event back to the source network.
        The message is transmitted using one of the supported cross-chain communication protocols (bridges, Hyperlane, Sygma).

    4. Source Network Synchronization:
        Upon receiving the message, the source network (e.g., EigenLayer) updates its own state to reflect the slashing event, ensuring consistency across chains.
        This includes penalizing the validator within the original protocol, if necessary, and synchronizing with Tangle’s slashing record.

## Why Cross-Chain Interoperability is Essential

As decentralized finance and blockchain ecosystems continue to evolve, cross-chain interoperability becomes increasingly critical.
Validators often operate on multiple networks simultaneously, which increases both the complexity and risk of misbehavior.
With Tangle’s Cross-Chain Restaking functionalities, we provide the following benefits:

    Universal Accountability:
        Validators know that their actions on one network can lead to consequences across multiple chains, which deters malicious activity.

    Security and Consistency:
        Cross-chain slashing ensures that all protocols are kept in sync, enhancing security and trust across interconnected blockchain ecosystems.

    Efficient and Reliable Communication:
        By utilizing multiple communication protocols (Bridges, Hyperlane, Sygma), Tangle ensures that cross-chain messages are delivered efficiently and securely.
