# Overview: Incorporating Symbiotic into Tangle

---- INCLUDES PLACEHOLDER TEXT ----

We are continually expanding our ecosystem to integrate with a variety of decentralized protocols, and Symbiotic
is one of the exciting networks we aim to support. While we are in the process of developing the necessary tools to
fully connect Tangle with Symbiotic, this document outlines what Symbiotic is and what its integration with Tangle will
mean for its users.

This page provides an overview of Symbiotic’s core features and placeholder information on how Tangle will be
integrated with Symbiotic once development is complete. Future updates will include specific functionality and
developer tools.

## What is Symbiotic?

Symbiotic is a decentralized protocol designed to foster interoperability and collaborative consensus across different
blockchain networks. It enables validators to participate in multiple networks simultaneously, contributing to the
security of various protocols while maximizing resource utilization.

### Key Features of Symbiotic:

    1. Multi-Chain Validation:
        Validators on Symbiotic are capable of participating in multiple blockchain networks at once, ensuring security
        across several ecosystems. This collaborative validation model allows protocols to share security while
        ensuring scalability and performance.

    2. Collaborative Consensus:
        Symbiotic uses a consensus mechanism designed to facilitate collaboration between validators from different
        networks. This ensures that protocols relying on Symbiotic benefit from a diverse set of validators, reducing
        the risk of centralization and increasing overall security.

    3. Interoperability Focus:
        One of Symbiotic’s primary goals is to enable seamless interoperability between various blockchain ecosystems.
        By allowing validators to interact with multiple protocols, Symbiotic enhances cross-chain functionality and
        enables new use cases for decentralized applications (dApps).

### Tangle-Symbiotic Integration

We are currently working on the tools and infrastructure necessary to fully integrate Tangle with Symbiotic. Once
development is complete, this section will outline how Tangle Validators can participate in Symbiotic’s collaborative
consensus model, and how cross-chain slashing and validator orchestration will be managed between the two networks.

### Key Planned Features for the Tangle-Symbiotic Integration:

    - Tangle Validator on Symbiotic:
        [Placeholder] Tangle validators will be able to participate in Symbiotic’s multi-chain validation model, contributing to both Symbiotic and Tangle’s ecosystems simultaneously.

    - Cross-Network Security:
        [Placeholder] Validators will benefit from enhanced security across both Symbiotic and Tangle. Misbehavior on one network could result in slashing on both networks through Tangle’s cross-chain slashing mechanism, ensuring consistency in accountability.

    - Interoperability Between Tangle and Symbiotic:
        [Placeholder] The integration will allow validators to interact with both networks in a streamlined manner, taking advantage of Symbiotic’s cross-chain communication capabilities while using Tangle’s advanced validator services.

## Developing with Symbiotic

### PLACEHOLDER

Symbiotic provides a range of tools for developers and validators to interact with its multi-chain validation system.
These tools allow validators to manage their participation across multiple networks and ensure that they can contribute
to collaborative consensus efficiently.
