# Overview: Incorporating EigenLayer AVSs into Tangle

We have built a powerful integration with EigenLayer through their Actively Validated Services (AVS).
We have enabled the ability for Validators to extend their functionality across both Tangle and EigenLayer's Networks. Users and developers can
leverage AVSs that operate simultaneously on both the EigenLayer and Tangle networks, creating new opportunities for
cross-chain functionalities.

This page provides an overview of how Tangle incorporates EigenLayer AVSs, including the creation of the Tangle AVS — an
EigenLayer AVS that runs a Tangle Validator — as well as the tools we provide for building AVSs in Rust. By combining
the strengths of EigenLayer’s decentralized security infrastructure with Tangle’s advanced validation and cross-chain
capabilities, users can interact with both networks via a single AVS.

## What is an EigenLayer AVS?

An Actively Validated Service (AVS) in EigenLayer allows Operators to provide services beyond traditional staking,
participating in security and decentralized services across multiple protocols.

More information on AVSs can be found [here](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/avs-guides/avs-developer-guide)

### How AVS Integrates with Tangle

Tangle takes the EigenLayer AVS model further by enabling validators to interact with both EigenLayer and Tangle at the
same time. This dual-functionality AVS leverages EigenLayer's re-staking capabilities while engaging with Tangle's
specialized cross-chain slashing, validator management, and orchestration features.

## The Tangle AVS: Dual-Functionality with EigenLayer

### What is the Tangle AVS?

The Tangle AVS is an EigenLayer-compatible AVS that runs a Tangle Validator, allowing participants to interact with
both the EigenLayer and Tangle networks through a single AVS. This unified AVS provides significant benefits for validators,
offering enhanced cross-network functionality while maintaining security and scalability.

### Key Features of the Tangle AVS:

    1. Seamless EigenLayer and Tangle Integration:
        The Tangle AVS is designed to fully integrate with EigenLayer’s re-staking mechanism, allowing validators to
        increase security for both networks while re-staking assets. The AVS serves both EigenLayer and Tangle simultaneously,
        optimizing cross-network interactions.

    2. Dual-Network Participation:
        Through the Tangle AVS, validators contribute to both Tangle's cross-chain slashing system and EigenLayer's
        decentralized validation services. This means validators operate in both ecosystems, providing security to EigenLayer
        protocols while benefiting from Tangle’s validator orchestration features.

    3. Cross-Network Security Enforcement:
        Validators using the Tangle AVS benefit from Tangle's cross-chain slashing and message dispatching, ensuring security
        across all the protocols they are involved with. Misbehavior on one network results in penalties and updates across
        both Tangle and EigenLayer, providing comprehensive validator accountability.

    4. Unified Validator Management:
        The Tangle AVS simplifies validator management, as users can run and manage their validators across both EigenLayer
        and Tangle via a single AVS. This significantly reduces operational overhead, while allowing for robust cross-chain services.

## Building AVSs in Rust: High-Performance Development Tools

We offer support for building AVSs in Rust, a modern programming language known for its performance, safety, and scalability.
Rust’s concurrency model makes it an excellent choice for developing Actively Validated Services that require high efficiency
and cross-network interaction.

### Why Choose Rust for AVS Development?

Rust is an ideal language for AVS development because it ensures memory safety, prevents common bugs like data races, and
can handle complex network interactions efficiently. When developing AVSs that run across both EigenLayer and Tangle, Rust
provides the necessary performance and reliability required to support scalable validator operations.

### Tools for Developing AVSs in Rust:

    1. Rust-Based AVS Implementations:
        At Tangle, we have developed EigenLayer’s Incredible Squaring AVS in Rust, which serves as a model for building
        efficient AVSs. This implementation highlights the potential of Rust in delivering high-performance
        Actively Validated Services that operate seamlessly across decentralized networks.

    2. Custom AVS Development:
        Developers can utilize our provided tools for creating their own AVSs in Rust. You can find the EigenSDK-RS
        [here](https://github.com/webb-tools/eigensdk-rs). Whether you want to add custom logic or integrate unique services,
        our Rust tools give developers the flexibility to innovate within the EigenLayer-Tangle ecosystem.

## The Intersection of Tangle and EigenLayer: Unified AVS Functionality

The integration between Tangle and EigenLayer through a single AVS offers a unique opportunity for validators to
participate in both networks while leveraging the best features of each ecosystem. This cross-network functionality
opens up new avenues for enhancing security, scaling decentralized services, and managing validator operations efficiently.

### Advantages of a Unified AVS:

    1. Cross-Network Validation and Security:
        Validators using the Tangle AVS actively participate in EigenLayer’s re-staking mechanism, providing security
        for EigenLayer protocols while engaging in Tangle’s cross-chain orchestration. This ensures that security
        efforts extend across both networks, reducing risks and increasing validator accountability.

    2. Efficient Resource Management:
        By running a single AVS across EigenLayer and Tangle, validators can manage resources more efficiently. This
        not only simplifies validator operations but also reduces the overhead of maintaining multiple services across
        decentralized ecosystems.

    3. Advanced Cross-Chain Slashing:
        The Tangle AVS enables cross-chain slashing, ensuring that any misbehavior by validators is enforced across
        both EigenLayer and Tangle. This cross-network enforcement deters malicious actions and upholds the integrity
        of the validator system across multiple chains.

    4. Developer Empowerment through Rust:
        With the tools and blueprints provided for developing AVSs in Rust, developers can easily build custom services
        and validators that take advantage of both EigenLayer’s and Tangle’s capabilities. This fosters innovation and
        opens up new possibilities for integrating decentralized services.
