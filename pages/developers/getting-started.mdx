# Getting Started with Tangle Blueprints

Welcome to the Tangle Blueprint tutorial! This guide will walk you through creating a simple `Hello World` Blueprint for Tangle. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a basic understanding of how to create, build, and deploy a Tangle Blueprint.

## What are Tangle Blueprints?

Tangle Blueprints are specifications for Actively Validated Services (AVS) on the Tangle Network. An AVS is an off-chain service that runs arbitrary computations for a user-specified period of time. Blueprints provide a useful abstraction, allowing developers to create reusable service infrastructures similar to smart contracts.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Forge](https://getfoundry.sh)
- [Tangle](https://github.com/tangle-network/tangle?tab=readme-ov-file#-getting-started-)
- `cargo-tangle` CLI tool

To install the Tangle CLI, run:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/tangle-network/gadget/releases/download/cargo-tangle/v0.1.1-beta.7/cargo-tangle-installer.sh | sh
```

Alternatively, install from source:

```bash
cargo install cargo-tangle --git https://github.com/tangle-network/gadget --force
```

## Creating a New Project

1. Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   cargo tangle gadget create --name hello-world-blueprint
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to set up your project.

## Project Structure

After creation, your project will have the following structure:

```
hello-world-blueprint/
├── src/
│ ├── lib.rs
│ └── main.rs
├── Cargo.toml
├── README.md
└── <other files>
```

Let's look at the key files:

### src/lib.rs

This file contains the core logic of your Blueprint, including job definitions, report structures, and event listeners. Here's an example of a simple "Hello World" job:

1. **Jobs**: Define the main computational tasks of your Blueprint. For more details on creating jobs, see our [Blueprint Job Tutorial](../developers/blueprint-macros#jobs).

2. **Reports**: Structure the output of your jobs. Learn more about reports in our [Blueprint Report Documentation](../developers/blueprint-macros#reports).

3. **Event Listeners**: Set up listeners to react to on-chain events. For a deep dive into event listeners, check out our [Event Listener Guide](../developers/blueprint-event-listeners).

Here's a basic example incorporating these elements:

```rust
use gadget_sdk as sdk;
use sdk::job;
use std::convert::Infallible;

/// Returns "Hello World!" if who is None, otherwise returns "Hello, <who>!"
#[job(id = 0, params(who), result(), verifier(evm = "HelloBlueprint"))]
pub fn say_hello(who: Option<String>) -> Result<String, Infallible> {
    match who {
        Some(who) => Ok(format!("Hello, {}!", who)),
        None => Ok("Hello World!".to_string()),
    }
}
```

This job takes an optional `who` parameter and returns a greeting.

### src/main.rs

This file serves as the entry point for your Actively Validated Service (AVS) node. It sets up the runtime environment, initializes the necessary components, and starts the event watcher. Here's a breakdown of its key responsibilities:

1. **Environment Setup**: It loads the configuration, initializes the logger, and sets up error handling.
2. **Client Initialization**: It creates a connection to the Tangle Network using the provided RPC endpoint.
3. **Registration**: It checks if the node should run registration (implementation pending).
4. **Event Handler Creation**: It instantiates the event handler for the `say_hello` job.
5. **Event Watcher**: It starts the Substrate event watcher, which listens for relevant events on the Tangle Network.

````rust
use color_eyre::Result;
use gadget_sdk as sdk;
use hello_world_blueprint as blueprint;
use sdk::{
    config::ContextConfig, events_watcher::substrate::SubstrateEventWatcher,
    events_watcher::tangle::TangleEventsWatcher, tangle_subxt::,
};
use structopt::StructOpt;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    init_logger();
    color_eyre::install()?;
    // Initialize the environment
    let config = ContextConfig::from_args();
    let env = sdk::config::load(config)?;
    let signer = env.first_sr25519_signer()?;
    let client = subxt::OnlineClient::from_url(&env.rpc_endpoint).await?;
    if env.should_run_registration() {
        todo!();
    }

    let service_id = env.service_id.expect("should exist");

    // Create the event handler from the job
    let say_hello_job = blueprint::SayHelloEventHandler { service_id, signer };
    tracing::info!("Starting the event watcher ...");
    SubstrateEventWatcher::run(
        &TangleEventsWatcher {
        span: env.span.clone(),
        },
        client,
        vec![Box::new(say_hello_job)],
    ).await?;
    Ok(())
}

fn init_logger() {
    let env_filter = tracing_subscriber::EnvFilter::from_default_env();
    tracing_subscriber::fmt()
    .compact()
    .with_target(true)
    .with_env_filter(env_filter)
    .init();
}


This sets up the AVS node, initializes the environment, and starts the event watcher.

## Building Your Project

To build your project, run:
```bash
cargo build
````

This command compiles your Rust code and checks for any errors.

## Deploying Your Blueprint

To deploy your Blueprint to the Tangle network, use:

```bash
cargo tangle gadget deploy
```

This command will package your Blueprint and deploy it to the Tangle network test environment.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've created, built, and deployed your first Tangle Blueprint. Here are some suggestions for what to do next:

1. Explore more complex job implementations in your `lib.rs` file. Learn more about [Jobs and the Job Macro system](/developers/blueprint-macros/jobs).

2. Implement reporting mechanisms using the [Reports Macro](/developers/blueprint-macros/reports) to ensure the integrity of your AVS.

3. Dive deeper into [Event Listeners](/developers/blueprint-macros/event-listeners) to understand how to trigger your jobs and reports based on various events.

4. Learn about [Context and Context Extensions](/developers/blueprint-macros/context) to manage dependencies and state in your Blueprint.

5. Implement [Custom Registration Hooks](/developers/blueprint-macros/jobs#custom-registration-hooks) to handle operator registration logic.

6. Explore [Request Hooks](/developers/blueprint-macros/jobs#implement-request-hooks) to manage incoming requests to your AVS.

7. If you're interested in building for EigenLayer, check out our guide on [Building an EigenLayer AVS](/developers/eigenlayer-avs).

8. Implement tests for your Blueprint using `tokio::test`. Learn more about [Testing Blueprints](/developers/blueprint-macros/testing).

9. Explore the Tangle network's features and how they interact with your Blueprint. Understand [EVM and Native Addresses](/developers/technicals/addresses) and [EVM to Substrate transfers](/developers/technicals/evm-substrate-transfers).

10. Familiarize yourself with [EVM Precompiles](/developers/technicals/precompiles) available on Tangle Network.
