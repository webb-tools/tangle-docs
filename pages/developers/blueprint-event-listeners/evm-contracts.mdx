# EVM Contract Listeners

EVM Contract Listeners are a powerful feature in the Gadget SDK that allow your blueprint to react to events emitted by smart contracts on EVM-compatible chains. These listeners use the `alloy` crate, which provides a robust and efficient way to interact with EVM chains.

## Overview

EVM Contract Listeners enable your blueprint to:

1. Monitor specific smart contracts for events
2. React to these events in real-time
3. Trigger custom logic based on the event data

# EvmContractEventListener

The `EvmContractEventListener` is a type that listens to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for events.

Like the `TangleEventListener`, the `EvmContractEventListener` is already implemented and ready to use. Simply register it in the `job` macro, and your application will automatically work with the EVM.

```rust
/// Returns x^2 saturating to [`u64::MAX`] if overflow occurs.
#[job(
    id = 0,
    params(x),
    result(_),
    event_listener(EvmContractEventListener(
        instance = IncredibleSquaringTaskManager,
        event = IncredibleSquaringTaskManager::NewTaskCreated,
        event_converter = convert_event_to_inputs,
        callback = IncredibleSquaringTaskManager::IncredibleSquaringTaskManagerCalls::respondToTask
    )),
)]
pub fn xsquare(
    x: u64,
) -> Result<u64, Infallible> {
    Ok(x.saturating_pow(2u32))
}
```
