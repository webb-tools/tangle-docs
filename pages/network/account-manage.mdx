# Create and Use an Account on Tangle Network

## Introduction

This guide will walk you through creating and managing your account on the Tangle Network through offical apps and browser extensions, which is the most common way users interface with the network.

## Simplifying Technical Terms

- **Mnemonic Phrase**: A secret set of words that allows access to your funds. Think of it as a password.
- **Substrate-Based Chains**: Different blockchains built using the Substrate framework, like Tangle Network.
- **A Substrate or 'SS58' Address Format**: A type of address format used in Substrate chains, including Polkadot and Tangle Network.

## Browser Extension Wallets: Options

This guide will focus on Polkadot Apps browser extension, a widely trusted system created by the developers of the Polkadot and Substrate ecosystems, however, it's important to note that this browser extension does only one thing: it manages accounts and allows the signing of transactions with those accounts. **It does not inject providers for use by dapps at this early point, nor does it perform wallet functions, e.g send funds.** You will use a web interface to conduct those transactions.

There are several wallets for browser and mobile developed for Substrate chains. [See our full Wallets page for details.](/wallets.mdx)
